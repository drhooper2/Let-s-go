        <h1>Practicing Code</h1>
        <p>On this page I will be practicing coding, from what I learned in the course. I have practiced a few times and actually had some good things happening on a page; even had some boxes around things, and a good footer.</p>
        My biggest issue seems to be getting a url from github. I suppose that will come in time.

    <div>
        <h2>Fingers Crossed</h2>

         <p>I really hope I have some luck this time, as I've tried a few times and things haven't worked out too well.</p>

        <h3>Reasons This Should Work</h5>
         <ol>
                <li>I have been trying really hard.</li>
                <li>I am determined to learn how to do this.</li>
         </ol>

        <p>I have been having some luck getting images to work for me, so that's something that's going right. I just discovered here that if I want my text to be under a photo, I have to be sure to start a new paragraph under the photo, otherwise it will start beside the photo at the bottom.</p>
    </div>

         <h3>How's It Going?</h3>

        alt="Looking Up" />

        <p>This cat makes me think of me sometimes in that I feel I just stare off into space.</p>

        <h4> Things I'm doing right!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>not giving up</li>
            <li>try and try again</li>
            <li>keeping enthusiastic about learning something new</li>
        </ul>
