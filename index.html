        <h1 class="title">Practicing Code</h1>
        <p>On this page I will be <em>practicing coding,</em> from what I learned in the course. I have practiced a few times and actually had some good things happening on a page; even had some boxes around things, and a good footer.</p>

    <div class="big-issue">
        <p>My biggest issue seems to be <em>getting a url from github.</em> I suppose that will come in time.</p>

        <h2>Fingers Crossed</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Lenovo\Documents\Website\Images\fingers-crossed-hopeful.gif" 
        alt="fingers crossed" />
        </img>

         <p>I really hope I have some luck this time, as I've tried a few times and things haven't worked out too well.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>Reasons This Should Work</h5>
         <ol>
                <li>I have been trying really hard.</li>
                <li>I am determined to learn how to do this.</li>
         </ol>

      

        <p>I have been having some luck getting images to work for me, so that's something that's going right. I just discovered here that <strong>if I want my text to be under a photo, I have to be sure to start a new paragraph under the photo,</strong> otherwise it will start beside the photo at the bottom.</p>
        </div>

    
         <h3>How's It Going?</h3>

        <p>This cat makes me think of me sometimes in that I feel I just stare off into space.</p>
    


        <h4> Things I'm doing right!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>not giving up</li>
            <li>try and try again</li>
            <li>keeping enthusiastic about learning something new</li>
        </ul>

        <section>
            <h1>Find Something for Here!</h1>
            <p>Finding my way around this thing. Figuring out how to size these spaces, and getting the colors to match. Looking pretty good.</p>
        </section>

        <!--not really sure about the section here, but will continue to investigate-->
