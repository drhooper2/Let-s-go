        <p>On this page I will be <em>practicing coding,</em> from what I learned in the course. I have practiced a few times and actually had some good things happening on a page; even had some boxes around things, and a good footer.</p>

        <p>My biggest issue seems to be <em>getting a url from github.</em> I suppose that will come in time.</p>
        <p>Ta da! I have a url. It has only taken me almost a week to get it, but I have it.</p>

         <p>I really hope I have some luck this time, as I've tried a few times and things haven't worked out too well.</p>

        <h2>Reasons This Should Work</h2>
         <ol>
                <li>I have been trying really hard.</li>
                <li>I am determined to learn how to do this.</li>
         </ol>

        <p>I have been having some luck getting images to work for me, so that's something that's going right. I just discovered here that <strong>if I want my text to be under a photo, I have to be sure to start a new paragraph under the photo,</strong> otherwise it will start beside the photo at the bottom.</p>
    <!--if I want something to be sectioned off, I need to put it in a section, duh, makes sense-->

        <p>This cat makes me think of me sometimes in that I feel I just stare off into space.</p>

            <p>I'm actually starting to find my way around here.<br>It has not been easy, and I have lost some hours I will never get back.</p>
            <p>Finding the right resources makes a huge difference, and I just found a great one that is now on my Kindle.</p>
