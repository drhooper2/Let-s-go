            <p>Learn more about our company in this section.<br>I am fillig in some text here to make the page longer.<br>This is to see if when the page is longer, and I click on the navigation bar, it will scroll down the page to the section I am looking for.<br>I love that I have discovered the br element and that I can actually do two consecutive paragraphs.<br>
            
            I wonder if this will skip a ling and begin a whole new paragraph.<br>There is only one way to find out, and that is by trying, saving and looking at each thing I add.</p>
            <p>I'm thinking this will give me a whole new paragraph, seeing as the br and then skipping two lines didnt work.</p>
            <p>Yes, that's what I have to do to get another sectioin. </p>
            <p>If I keep at this, I will eventually get it.<br>I won't get any work done, and my house will be a total disaster, but I will have used my brain, persisted, and learned something new.<br>A small price to pay.
